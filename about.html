                    <h2>Hi, my name is Jenni!</h2>
                    <p>I'm a self taught web developer. I run a blog with friends called <em>Southern Friends & Co.</em> We love to cook and share our recipes. As you can probably tell from the title, I'm from the south. That means good cookin'! Grandma had me in the kitchen since I was four, and I really haven't left it. My favorite foods to make are savory dinners and full course breakfasts. <br> </p>
                    <p>My loves in life are cooking, traveling, and family! Cooking can be done anywhere you can light a fire. And don't let me get started on where I want to travel! Family is everything. My partner, Cody, and I have two wonderful fur-babies: Coco and Chewy. Both are Yorkie rescues and made us fall in love within the first moment of meeting them! They definitely run the house.
